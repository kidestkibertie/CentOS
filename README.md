CentOS installation detail information
# installtion
CentOS Stream installation begins by downloading the official ISO file from the CentOS website.
Next, a new virtual machine is created in VirtualBox with appropriate hardware settings.
The ISO file is mounted to the virtual machine to boot and start the installation.
Users then configure language, disk, network, and user settings through the installer GUI.
Once installation completes, the system reboots into a fully functional CentOS Stream environment.
